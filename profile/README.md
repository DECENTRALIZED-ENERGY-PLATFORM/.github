# Decentralized Energy Platform

A decentralized energy trading platform is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that allows individuals, businesses, and other entities to buy and sell solar energy directly with one another without the need for a centralized authority or intermediary. This platform leverages blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and automated transactions.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading**: Direct transactions between energy buyers and sellers without the need for intermediaries.
- **Blockchain-Powered**: Ensures security, transparency, and immutability for all transactions on the platform.
- **Automated Contracts**: Smart contracts automate and enforce trade agreements.
- **Renewable Energy Focus**: Facilitates trading in renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Core technology for decentralized and transparent transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated contracts for trading, ensuring trust and security.
- **P2P Network**: Peer-to-peer architecture to support direct energy trading.

## How It Works

1. **Energy Generation**: Individuals or businesses generate solar energy using photovoltaic (PV) systems.
2. **Energy Sale**: Energy producers list the excess energy they want to sell on the platform.
3. **Energy Purchase**: Buyers browse available energy listings and make purchases based on their energy needs.
4. **Blockchain Transactions**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
5. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts automatically execute the energy trade once the terms are met, ensuring trust and reducing the need for intermediaries.
